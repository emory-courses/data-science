	In this paper, we propose an adversarial multi-task learning framework,

	each other.
	We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification tasks,

	knowledge and easily transferred to new tasks.

	remarkable performance on several tasks, including word analogy questions and
	caption generation. An unexpected "side-effect" of such models is that their
	vectors often exhibit compositionality, i.e., adding two word-vectors
	results in a vector that is only a small angle away from the vector of a word
	representing the semantic composite of the original words, e.g., "man" +
	"royal" = "king".
	This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive
	compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. In
	particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter
	sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the
	process generating the corpus. As a corollary, it explains the success of
	vector calculus in solving word analogies. When these assumptions do not hold,
	this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator. 
	Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the
	Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby:
	the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models
	simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. This shows that Skip-Gram
	embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further,
	implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models

  abstract  = {Our goal is to learn a semantic parser that maps natural language utterances
	into executable programs when only indirect supervision is available: examples
	are labeled with the correct execution result, but not the program itself.
	Consequently, we must search the space of programs for those that output the
	correct result, while not being misled by spurious programs: incorrect
	programs that coincidentally output the correct result. We connect two common
	learning paradigms, reinforcement learning (RL) and maximum marginal likelihood
	(MML), and then present a new learning algorithm that combines the strengths of
	both. The new algorithm guards against spurious programs by combining the
	systematic search traditionally employed in MML with the randomized exploration
	of RL, and by updating parameters such that probability is spread more evenly
	across consistent programs. We apply our learning algorithm to a new neural
	semantic parser and show significant gains over existing state-of-the-art
	results on a recent context-dependent semantic parsing task.},

	on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a
	static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention
	model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary.
	In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based
	summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with

	task to learn richer context-aware video encoder representations, and a
	logically-directed language entailment generation task to learn better
	video-entailing caption decoder representations. For this, we present a
	many-to-many multi-task learning model that shares parameters across the
	encoders and decoders of the three tasks. We achieve significant improvements

	Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but
	this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce
	non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic
	correction of transcripts.  In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex
	networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short
	texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were
	applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in
	transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the
	performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic
	features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and
	Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using
	only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other
	classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and
	Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably
	owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded
	higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually
	revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched
	with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments.},
